  <h1>LINDSEY RODRIGUEZ</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Lindsey Rodriguez but you can just simply call me Lin. I was born and raised in New York City, the Bronx to be more specific and I am the child of an immigrant mother who came to the United States when she was just 20 years old so that she could give my family and I a life that she always envisioned. Because of this, I not only embrace my identity as a woman of color, but celebrate it as well and only align myself with companies and brands who celebrate inclusivity. I am someone who is extremely goal driven and will stop at nothing to achieve my dreams of becoming a creative director for the biggest fashion brands, marketing teams, magazines and even music videos as well as photo shoots. I am an up and coming freelance graphic designer and I am on the road to reaching my goal of becoming a legend in the world of creative directing one step at a time. I am currently studying general media at Hunter College with a focus in digital studies right now which is slowly but surely preparing me to enter the world of art and technology and bringing me one step closer to my goal. I have a strong passion for art and the world of fashion and design and my ultimate goal is to become a household name in the world of modeling and creative directing and I will stop at absolutely nothing to achieve these things!
